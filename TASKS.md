# Dependencies Implementation Progress

## âœ… Completed

### Core Features
- **Async/Await Support** (v0.0.2) - Full support for dependency injection across async boundaries

### Built-in Dependencies
1. **RandomNumberGenerator** - Random number generation with deterministic testing
2. **FileManager** - File system operations with mocking
3. **UserDefaults** - User preferences with isolated test suites
4. **URLSession** - Network requests with mocking
5. **NotificationCenter** - Notification-based communication
6. **Logger** - Structured logging with test capture
7. **Analytics** - Event tracking with test verification
8. **FeatureFlags** - Feature toggles for A/B testing

## ðŸš§ In Progress

None

## ðŸ“‹ TODO

### Time & Scheduling
9. **Timer/Clock** - Time-based operations and delays
10. **MainQueue/Scheduler** - Queue-based operations

### Application Context
11. **Device Info** - Device model, OS version, battery level
12. **Connectivity** - Network status and connection type
13. **LocationManager** - Location services

### Utility
14. **Keychain** - Secure storage with mocking
15. **Pasteboard/Clipboard** - Copy/paste functionality

## Notes

- All dependencies use `nonisolated(unsafe)` for non-Sendable types
- Each dependency includes comprehensive tests
- Tests demonstrate default values, overrides, and scoped behavior
- v0.0.2 adds full async/await support with TaskLocal storage for proper dependency propagation
